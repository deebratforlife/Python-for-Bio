# Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
# Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. 
# You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

# The following example has a function with one argument (fname).

def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " sequences")
 
# When the function is called, we pass along a first name, 
# which is used inside the function to print the full name:

# Example
# my_function("3' UTR")
# Output: 3' UTR Sequences
