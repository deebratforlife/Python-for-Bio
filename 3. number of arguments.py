# By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. 
# Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, 
# you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.

def my_function(fname, lname):
  print (fname + "|" + lname)  

# Call this function with 2 arguments:
# my_function("3' UTR", "sequences")

# Output: 3' UTR sequences
